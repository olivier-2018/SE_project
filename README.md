# Software Engineering project 
## REST API development in Machine Learning applications

## Project goal & requirements:  
• Develop an API from a trained machine learning model. 
• Use GIT concept through the API development. 
• Use of CI/CD pipeline is recommended for additional credits.
• The API should include testing, code formating and logging.
• The API should be executable. 
• Documentation and presentation should be available upon submission

## Project requirement: 
• The selected ML model for this project is the audio MNIST which identifies digits from audio inputs.
• The API shall take as input an audio signal (either file or captured audio) and return the corresponding digit
